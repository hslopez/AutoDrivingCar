Design & Architecture

Core Components
Interfaces-Driven Design
ICar: Defines car operations (movement, rotation, collision handling)
IField: Manages field boundaries and validation
ISimulation: Orchestrates command processing and collision detection

SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility: Each class handles specific domain logic
Open/Closed: Extensible through interfaces
Dependency Inversion: Components depend on abstractions

Key Features
Step-by-step command processing
Collision detection with step tracking
Field boundary validation
Immutable collision records
Assumptions
Input Validation
Users provide valid commands (L/R/F)
Car positions start within field boundaries
Unique car names enforced
Movement Rules
Invalid moves are ignored
Rotation happens instantaneously
Collisions stop further movement
Field Definition
Zero-indexed grid (0,0) to (Width-1, Height-1)
Minimum field size 1x1

Windows 10/11 (x64)

Example Test
[Test]
public void ThreeCarCollision_AllRegisterImpact()
{
    var field = new Field(10, 10);
    var simulation = new Simulation(field);
    
    simulation.AddCar(new Car("A", 1, 1, Direction.East, "FF"));
    simulation.AddCar(new Car("B", 3, 1, Direction.West, "FF"));
    simulation.AddCar(new Car("C", 2, 1, Direction.North, "F"));
    
    simulation.Run();
    
    Assert.That(simulation.GetCars().All(c => c.Collision != null));
}

Readability & Maintenance
Code Quality
Naming Conventions
Clear, descriptive names (ProcessCommand, RegisterCollision)
Consistent casing (PascalCase for methods, camelCase for locals)
Documentation
XML comments for public members
Error code documentation
Encapsulation
Private fields/methods for internal logic
Immutable DTOs for data transfer
Maintenance Features
Null Safety
Nullable reference types enabled
Guard clauses for null checks
Error Handling
Custom exceptions for domain errors
Input validation at boundaries
Extensibility
Interface-based dependencies
Protected virtual methods for overriding

Key Execution Scenarios
Sample Input/Output
Welcome to Auto Driving Car Simulation!
Field size: 10x10

Car A: (1,2) N, Commands: FFRFFFRRL
Car B: (7,8) W, Commands: FFLFFFFF

Simulation Results:
A collided with B at (5,4) step 7
B collided with A at (5,4) step 7
The design emphasizes testability and maintainability while adhering to .NET best practices. The interface-based architecture allows easy swapping of components (e.g., different collision detection algorithms) without impacting core functionality.
